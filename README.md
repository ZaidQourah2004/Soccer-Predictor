# Soccer-Predictor

Soccer-Predictor is a comprehensive project designed to scrape match statistics for over 700 players, manipulate and present the data dynamically, and predict match outcomes using machine learning. The project is divided into three main components: Backend, Data Scraping, and Machine Learning.

## Features

### Data Scraping
- Engineered a comprehensive data scraping of match statistics for 700+ players using Python and pandas.

### Backend
- Dynamic manipulation and presentation of the scraped data through a Spring Boot application.

### Database
- Real-time data manipulation within a PostgreSQL database using SQL queries.

### Machine Learning
- Created a model to predict match outcomes by integrating data scraping with pandas and machine learning with scikit-learn.

## Components

### Data Scraping
- **Technology:** Python, pandas
- **Description:** This component scrapes match statistics for over 700 players and stores the data in a CSV file for further processing.

### Backend
- **Technology:** Spring Boot, Java
- **Description:** This component dynamically manipulates and presents the scraped data. It uses SQL queries to manage real-time data manipulation within a PostgreSQL database.

### Machine Learning
- **Technology:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas
- **Description:** This component creates a machine learning model to predict match outcomes based on the scraped data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or later
- Python 3.8 or later
- PostgreSQL
- Maven
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZaidQourah2004/Soccer-Predictor.git
   cd Soccer-Predictor
   ```

2. Set up the Python environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the PostgreSQL database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE soccer_predictor;
   ```

4. Update the database configuration in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

5. Run the data scraping script:
   ```bash
   python MatchPredicting/PL_Predictor.py
   ```

6. Build and run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

### Usage

- Access the backend API to retrieve and manipulate player match statistics.
- Use the machine learning model to predict match outcomes based on the scraped data.
